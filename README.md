<b>Guardia, the typeface</b><br>
<b>October 2021</b><br>
   
Guardia is a typeface inspired by the logotype of the Spanish National Police. Making this typeface is embedded in the author’s interest in researching the typographic imaginary; on how we can understand type as a technical and ideological tool influencing social and cultural conditions, particularly through the links between cultural geography and the graphic design fields. <br>

In that sense, Guardia is interesting to us because it is—in our opinion—deeply rooted in a 1980–⁠90s graphic design aesthetic inspired by police forces as depicted in blockbusters movies such as 1993’s Demolition Man or 1987’s RoboCop. <br>

We can perhaps assume that the designers in charge of the visual identity of the Spanish National Police were therefore aware that they were reflecting a science-fiction vernacular aesthetic in the graphic design of the Cuerpo Nacional de Policía, present all over Spain. <br>

We believe such a process should be approached critically and be (easily) re-appropriated and reused. This is the main motivation on why Guardia is released for everyone on a SIL Open Font Licence (with some exceptions).</div>
